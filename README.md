# NasPay Demo Client

### Reference Documentation
Demo client for getting transaction status.

Java client implementation for Naspay REST API.

The client must accept Terminal Key and Terminal Secret as constructor arguments
and implement a single method: getTransactionStatus.

The method must call GET /api/v1/transactions/{id} endpoint, process errors (if any),
parse the response and return the transaction state as a string.

Additional requirements:
- API token is valid for 8 hours, but revoked if not used for more than 15 minutes. It
would be good to use the same token (if possible) for subsequent API calls.
- The client must by thread-safe.
- Implementation tests must be provided (see test data below)
